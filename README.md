# Induction-Motor-Fault-Detection-using-Support-Vector-Machine
This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to detect faults in induction motors. By analyzing sensor data, it identifies issues like bearing faults, rotor defects, and winding problems. Early detection helps prevent costly repairs and improves industrial efficiency.
The dataset used for this project contains operational data from motors under different fault conditions, and SVM is trained to detect anomalies and predict faults.

 Features: 
   Fault detection : Identify faults in induction motors such as bearing defects, rotor problems, and winding failures.
   SVM based classifier : Uses the powerful Support Vector Machine algorithm for classification tasks.
   Data preprocessing : Includes necessary data cleaning and normalization steps before feeding it into the SVM model.
   Evaluation metrics : The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

 How to Use: 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
