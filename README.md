# Induction-Motor-Fault-Detection-using-Support-Vector-Machine
This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to detect faults in induction motors. By analyzing sensor data, it identifies issues like bearing faults, rotor defects, and winding problems. Early detection helps prevent costly repairs and improves industrial efficiency.
